# 🎯 Mini Project: Console-Based Calculator in Java

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**
A simple yet powerful calculator developed using **Java**, featuring a fully interactive **menu-driven console interface**. Users can select operations from a text-based menu, input numbers, and instantly receive results—all directly within the terminal environment.

This project simulates the feel of a traditional handheld calculator but through the command line, making it an excellent learning tool for understanding control flow, logic building, and user input handling in Java.

### 🖥️ Sample Console Interface
